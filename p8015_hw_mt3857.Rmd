## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
#Use the code below to download the a package containing the penguins dataset:
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
#load the penguins dataset
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
#Make a scatterplot of flipper_length_mm (y) vs bill_length_mm (x); color points using the species variable (adding color = ... inside of aes in your ggplot code should help
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Flipper Length vs Bill Length", x = "Bill Length (mm)", y = "Flipper Length (mm)")

ggsave("scatterplot_penguins.png")

```

#problem 2

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)

set.seed(123)

df <- tibble(
  random_sample = rnorm(10),
  logical_vector = random_sample > 0,
  character_vector = sample(letters, 10),
  factor_vector = factor(sample(c("level1", "level2", "level3"), 10, replace = TRUE))
)

# View the created data frame
df
# Use map to apply mean function to each column in the dataframe
mean_results <- df %>%
  map(~ if(is.numeric(.)) mean(., na.rm = TRUE) else NA)

# Display results of attempting to calculate means
mean_results
df_converted <- df %>%
  mutate(
    logical_numeric = as.numeric(logical_vector),
    character_numeric = as.numeric(character_vector),
    factor_numeric = as.numeric(factor_vector)
  )

# View the converted dataframe
df_converted


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
